Exploring Java: A Project-Based Approach
Welcome to my repository of Java applications and exercises. This collection is dedicated to showcasing a practical application of core programming principles, creative problem-solving, and the fundamentals of object-oriented design. You'll find a variety of projects here, from simple console utilities to more complex systems, all documenting my growth as a Java developer.

Core Objectives
Skill Cultivation: To continuously refine and enhance my Java coding proficiency through consistent practice.

OOP Exploration: To deeply investigate and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms in real-world scenarios.

Portfolio Development: To build a robust collection of work that demonstrates my learning path and serves as a professional showcase.

Project Roadmap
Here's a look at the projects currently planned for this repository:

Simple Calculator

Number Guessing Challenge

Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Core Banking System

Library Management Application

Student Grading Utility

This list will expand over time, with new applications being added to reflect increasing complexity and newly acquired skills.

Technology Stack
The projects within this repository are built using the following technologies and concepts:

Java 23

Object-Oriented Design Principles

Fundamental Java Concepts: Including loops, conditional logic, classes, objects, arrays, and file I/O operations.

Getting Started
Each project is contained within its own dedicated folder. Inside each folder, you will find a specific README.md file that provides detailed instructions on how to compile, run, and interact with the program.

This repository is an active and evolving space. I will be updating it frequently with new creations and improvements.
